# twitch-irc-client-pwa

Cheep comment viewer for Twitch.

This is personal project for learning Vue.js.

# Usage

- OIDC-authenticate for Twitch at left menu.
  - It's OK if you do it or not. If you don't authenticate, you can't send your message.
- Connect IRC channel by click card at "Home" view.
  - If you didn't authenticate, you can't connect channel by click card. So input channel name directly from "channel" menu.
